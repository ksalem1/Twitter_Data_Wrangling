This project was done and submitted in partial fulfillment of the data analysis nanodegree program offered by Udacity platfrom.

The main objectives of this project was to gather data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness and ultimately clean issues identified.
All of the data wrangling efforts were done and stored in a Jupyter notebook where cleaned data was then showcased through analyses and visualizations mainly using Python's libraries.
