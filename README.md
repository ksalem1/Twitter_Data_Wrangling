# Data Wrangling

## Completed as part of Udacity's data analysis nanodegree

This project was done and submitted in partial fulfillment of the data analysis nanodegree program offered by Udacity platfrom.

The main objectives of this project was to gather data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness and ultimately clean issues identified.
All of the data wrangling efforts were done and stored in a Jupyter notebook where cleaned data was then showcased through analyses and visualizations mainly using Python's libraries.
